This research report explores and analyzes substance abuse, especially in youngsters, investigating and differentiating between different drugs and the effects they impose with the focus on personality traits and intelligence quotient. It analyses whether people use various drugs and if yes, the frequency of their usage. It explores whether these substance usages impact a person’s personality traits and IQ scores. It also explores whether drugs have different effects on different people. The inter-dependencies of one drug to another, as well as the usage pattern of different drugs based on gender, age and frequency levels have also been examined and visualized.

Considering drug usage and personality traits, the following patterns are identified. Usage of ketamine has been found to have a significant relationship between a person’s sense of agency scores. The frequency of usage of ketamine, mushrooms and cannabis showed to have a significant effect on people’s intentionality bias scores. None of the drugs tested either the usage or the frequency of usage have been found to impact a person’s unpredictability scores. And finally, the frequency of usage of psychotropics has been found to affect free will scores.

Moving on to IQ level and drug usage, only the frequency of usage of mushrooms has been found to have a significant relationship with IQ scores of people. Considering IQ level and personality trait scores, the scores of no personality traits tested (sense of agency, intentionality bias, unpredictability, and free will) has been found to affect IQ scores. Hence, it has been concluded that there is no significant relationship between personality trait scores and IQ scores.

The drugs used by the highest number of people is cannabis and the drug used by the lowest number of people is ketamine. The most used three drugs are cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamine, respectively. After this, cocaine, mushrooms, and LSD are used in that specific order. All the drugs except for LSD are used by a higher percentage of men more than women while men and women use LSD equally. The drug that has a higher difference between percentage of male and female users is ketamine. The frequency levels and gender divisions for all the above mentioned drugs have been visualized using graphs as well.
While checking the dependancies between one drug to another for the top three most used drugs, it has been found that all the three drugs(cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamine) influence the usage of all the other drugs examined. Hence, a strong evidencehas been found that a person who uses one drug is more prone to try another drug as well.

While examining the impacts of the drugs on different people, for all the drugs tested, age has been a factor that affects the usage of them. IQ score significantly influences the usage of cannabis, LSD and mushroom meaning people with different IQ scores tend to have been influenced to use the said drugs differently. Lastly the narcissism scores of people have been found to have a significant relationship with only amphetamine usage.

The limitations of this research would be that the data used is secondary, and the questionnaires used to get data, even though anonymous could not be concluded to have perfect reliability. It is also worth noticing that it could not be shown how and why exactly different drugs have different impacts on different types of people. Nonetheless, this research contributes to understanding the effects of drug usage on young individuals and highlights the importance of addressing substance abuse in society.
